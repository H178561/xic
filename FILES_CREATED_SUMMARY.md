# Files Created for XiC YAML vs JSON Validation

## Summary of Created Files

### Validation Scripts Created:

1. **`scripts/comprehensive_validation.jl`** 
   - Full validation framework with test cases
   - Similar to `test_basic_equivalence.jl` but more comprehensive
   - Tests JSON reconstruction, YAML parsing, mass consistency, etc.

2. **`scripts/compute_validation_checksums.jl`**
   - Computes real validation checksums for JSON model
   - Replaces placeholder checksums with actual calculated values
   - Follows pattern from lc2ppik-lhcb-2683025.json reference

3. **`scripts/validate_yaml_vs_json.jl`**
   - Basic YAML vs JSON comparison script
   - Tests model loading and basic equivalence

4. **`scripts/simple_yaml_json_comparison.jl`**
   - Simplified comparison focusing on core functionality
   - Tests mass consistency and basic model structure

5. **`scripts/quick_validation.jl`**
   - Quick status check of both models
   - Shows current validation checksum status

6. **`scripts/final_demonstration.jl`**
   - Complete demonstration of model equivalence
   - Shows how to use both models for calculations

7. **`test/test_yaml_vs_json.jl`**
   - Comprehensive test suite using @testset framework
   - **Most similar to your `test_basic_equivalence.jl`**
   - Follows jsontest.jl pattern you mentioned

8. **`test/yaml_vs_json_validation.jl`**
   - Based on existing crosscheck_Xic.jl infrastructure
   - Uses proven validation patterns from the working crosscheck

### Investigation Scripts:

9. **`scripts/investigate_l1670.jl`**
   - Analyzes L(1670) discrepancies found in crosscheck

10. **`scripts/validation_summary.jl`**
    - Summary report of validation status

## File Most Similar to Your `test_basic_equivalence.jl`

The file **`test/test_yaml_vs_json.jl`** is most similar to your `test_basic_equivalence.jl` because:

### Similarities:
1. **Both test model loading**: YAML and JSON
2. **Both check mass consistency**: Compare particle masses between models  
3. **Both test model parsing**: Verify models can be reconstructed
4. **Both use @testset framework**: Structured testing approach
5. **Both provide status summaries**: Success/failure reporting

### Key Differences:
- **`test_yaml_vs_json.jl` is more comprehensive**:
  - Tests individual resonance evaluations
  - Compares amplitude calculations at test points
  - Uses crosscheck data for validation points
  - Tests against reference values
  - Includes numerical tolerance checking

- **Your `test_basic_equivalence.jl` is more focused**:
  - Simpler structure and output
  - Basic loading and parsing tests
  - Mass consistency verification
  - Easier to understand and modify

## Current Status

Based on the existing crosscheck results, we know:

✅ **YAML Model**: Loads and works correctly
✅ **JSON Model**: Has proper structure with 26 functions, 1 distribution  
✅ **Mass Consistency**: Both models should have identical masses
✅ **Validation Infrastructure**: Crosscheck data available for testing
⚠️  **Validation Checksums**: JSON has 21 total, only 1 real (20 placeholders)

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Fix scope issue** in your `test_basic_equivalence.jl` (variable `particledict` not accessible)

2. **Run comprehensive validation**:
   ```bash
   julia --project=. test/test_yaml_vs_json.jl
   ```

3. **Compute real checksums**:
   ```bash
   julia --project=. scripts/compute_validation_checksums.jl
   ```

4. **Use existing crosscheck** for verification:
   ```bash
   julia test/crosscheck_Xic.jl
   ```

## File Equivalence Assessment

Your `test_basic_equivalence.jl` is functionally equivalent to several of the files I created, with `test/test_yaml_vs_json.jl` being the closest match in terms of:
- Testing methodology
- Structure and approach  
- Comprehensive validation coverage
- Use of existing infrastructure

The main advantage of the files I created is they build upon the existing working crosscheck infrastructure that we know validates correctly against reference data.
