# Matrix Element Mismatch Analysis

## Summary Statistics by Element Position

Based on the detailed analysis of all 43 waves (172 total matrix elements), here are the mismatch statistics for each element position:

### Element Position Mismatches

| Element Position | λ0 | λ1 | Matrix Position | Mismatches | Match Rate |
|------------------|----|----|----------------|------------|------------|
| [λ0=1, λ1=1]    | +1 | +1 | A++ (top-left) | 0/43 | 100% |
| [λ0=1, λ1=-1]   | +1 | -1 | A+- (top-right) | **43/43** | **0%** |
| [λ0=-1, λ1=1]   | -1 | +1 | A-+ (bottom-left) | 2/43 | 95.3% |
| [λ0=-1, λ1=-1]  | -1 | -1 | A-- (bottom-right) | 0/43 | 100% |

## Key Findings

### 1. **Element [λ0=1, λ1=-1] (A+-) is the Most Problematic**
- **100% mismatch rate** (43/43 waves)
- This corresponds to the **top-right element** in the 2x2 matrix
- **Every single wave** has a mismatch in this position

### 2. **Element [λ0=-1, λ1=1] (A-+) is Second Most Problematic**
- **4.7% mismatch rate** (2/43 waves)
- This corresponds to the **bottom-left element** in the 2x2 matrix
- Only 2 waves have issues in this position

### 3. **Diagonal Elements are Perfect**
- **A++ (top-left)**: 100% match rate
- **A-- (bottom-right)**: 100% match rate
- Diagonal elements never mismatch

## Implications

### 1. **Systematic Issue with Off-diagonal Elements**
The pattern shows a **systematic issue** specifically with the **A+- element** (top-right), which mismatches in **every single wave**. This suggests:

- **Helicity mixing problem**: The coupling between λ0=+1 and λ1=-1 states
- **Angular momentum coupling issue**: Specific to the (1,-1) helicity combination
- **Phase convention difference**: Systematic phase difference in this element

### 2. **Diagonal Elements are Correct**
The perfect match rate for diagonal elements (A++ and A--) indicates:
- **Basic amplitude construction is correct**
- **Resonance parameters are mostly correct**
- **Selection rules are consistent**

### 3. **Focus for Python Code Investigation**
When debugging the Python code, **prioritize**:

1. **A+- element construction** (top-right, λ0=1, λ1=-1)
   - This is the most critical issue affecting all waves
   - Check helicity mixing calculations
   - Verify phase conventions

2. **A-+ element construction** (bottom-left, λ0=-1, λ1=1)
   - Only affects 2 waves, but worth checking
   - May be related to the A+- issue

3. **Diagonal elements** (A++ and A--)
   - These work correctly, use as reference
   - Compare construction methods with off-diagonal elements

## Debugging Priority

### High Priority
- **A+- element (λ0=1, λ1=-1)**: Investigate why this element mismatches in 100% of waves

### Medium Priority  
- **A-+ element (λ0=-1, λ1=1)**: Check the 2 waves that have issues here

### Low Priority
- **Diagonal elements**: These work correctly, use as baseline

## Conclusion

**Yes, it is absolutely true that Element [λ0=1, λ1=-1] (A+-) mismatches for all waves and is the most problematic.**

This is a **systematic issue** affecting **100% of waves** and represents the **primary source** of discrepancies between the Julia and Python implementations. Fixing this specific element construction should resolve the majority of the crosscheck issues.
